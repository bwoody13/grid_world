# grid_world
Trying various RL algorithms on grid_wrold

Expanding on https://github.com/MushroomRL/mushroom-rl/blob/dev/examples/grid_world_td.py, which replicates the experiments on the Grid World MDP as presented in: "Double Q-Learning", Hasselt H. V.. 2010.


Already-implemented agents are tested and the following agents are to be added (Value-based algorithms from https://mushroomrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/mushroom_rl.algorithms.value.html)
TD: SARSALambda, ExpectedSARSA, QLambda, RLearning, MaxminQLearning, RQLearning (ALREADY ADDED)
Batch TD: FQI, DoubleFQI, BoostedFQI, LSPI (NOT YET ADDED)
DQN: DQN and variants (NOT YET ADDED)
